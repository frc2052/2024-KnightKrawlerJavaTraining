Hint 1: The bug in the prime checker is related to incorrect results for some input values. Think about how prime numbers are defined and how you can check for divisibility to determine if a number is prime.

Hint 2: Check the loop condition in the checkPrime method. Consider what values you should iterate through when checking for divisibility, and whether the loop bounds are set correctly.
